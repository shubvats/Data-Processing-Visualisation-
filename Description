2. Use comments in the script file(s) to specify your name, the purpose for each task, and purpose
for each code block. (10’)
3. Label your file(s) or tasks with the numbers in the above list. (10’)
4. Your codes match with your task descriptions and generate correct results. (60’)
60 points will be evenly distributed to each task picked from the list, e.g. if you select 10 out of
13, each task is worth 6 points.
5. Submit a zip file that contains your data file and scripts. File name format is
lastname_project2.zip.
